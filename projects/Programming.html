    <h1>Dunnhumby Retail Analytics Project</h1>
    <br>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This retail analytics project examines two years of household-level grocery data from the Dunnhumby 
      <em>Complete Journey</em> dataset to uncover patterns in customer behavior, sales performance, campaign 
      effectiveness, and inventory volatility. Using extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory 
      analytics, and market basket analysis, the project evaluates how key demographic groups drive revenue, 
      how discounts and coupons influence purchasing, and which product pairings most strongly shape basket value. 
      The final insights provide a data-driven framework for improving pricing strategy, promotional design, 
      inventory forecasting, and merchandising decisions across a competitive retail environment.

    <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Data Integration: Merged multi-table datasets (transactions, demographics, products, campaigns, coupons) into a single analytical pipeline.</li>
      <li>Feature Engineering: Created customer-level and product-level indicators for segmentation, volatility tracking, and marketing evaluation.</li>
      <li>EDA: Conducted demographic segmentation, category-level wallet share analysis, sales volatility assessment, and discount–quantity correlation testing.</li>
      <li>Market Basket Analysis: Applied Lift scoring to identify high-value co-purchase relationships for merchandising and cross-promotion.</li>
      <li>Marketing Evaluation: Assessed the ROI of three campaign types using pre-/post-performance metrics for spending and trip behavior.</li>
      <li>Coupon Effectiveness: Demonstrated that 97.6% of redeemed coupons were used on first-time purchases, proving coupons act as trial—not loyalty—drivers.</li>
      <li>Operational Analysis: Measured weekly sales and quantity volatility to uncover hidden risks in inventory planning.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Skills Demonstrated</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Data cleaning, multi-table merging, and preprocessing</li>

      <li>Market Basket Analysis (MBA) using Lift metrics</li>
      <li>Customer segmentation and demographic profiling</li>
      <li>Volatility modeling using coefficient of variation (CV)</li>
      <li>Campaign and coupon effectiveness analysis</li>
      <li>Interpretation of consumer behavior and operational performance</li>
      <li>Technical reporting and business insight communication</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Technologies Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Python – pandas, numpy, matplotlib</li>
      <li>Jupyter Notebook – analysis environment</li>
      <li>Dunnhumby Complete Journey Dataset – 2 years of household-level transactions</li>
      <li>Excel – supplemental EDA and data validation</li>
      <li>Statistical analysis & Lift-based market basket tools</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Why This Project Matters</h3>
    <p>
      This project highlights the value of data science in solving real-world retail challenges.  
      Through a combination of data engineering, customer segmentation, pricing analysis, and 
      marketing evaluation, the study reveals how retailers can better understand their core 
      customer groups, optimize promotional spending, improve inventory stability, and leverage 
      product affinities to increase basket size. The work reflects a holistic retail analytics 
      pipeline, transforming raw multi-table data into actionable operational and strategic 
      recommendations.
