     <h1>Housing Affordability in Toronto, Scrollytelling Data Story</h1>
    <br>
     <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  
     <p>
      his project explores the growing housing affordability crisis in Toronto, 
      with a specific focus on first-time home buyers. Using real data from Statistics Canada, 
      National Bank, CMHC, and Ratehub, the goal was to transform a complex social and economic issue into a clear, 
      engaging, and data-driven visual narrative.</br>
      
      The project evolved through three iterations: brainstorming, early visual drafting, and finally a full scrollytelling experience designed in Canva. The final iteration is the core highlight and is the version showcased in this portfolio.

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Explain why housing affordability has worsened in Toronto</li>
        <li>Show how this impacts young and first-time home buyers</li>
        <li>Identify barriers (income, savings, stress test, mortgage rates) preventing homeownership</li>
        <li>Suggest practical strategies that might help new buyers</li>
    </ul>
  <br>

  <h2>Final Scrollytelling Narrative</h2>
  <p>The last iteration is a polished, narrative-driven scrollytelling piece built in Canva. 
    It combines data visualizations, story flow, and human-centered messaging to engage viewers.

  <h3>Tools & Methods</h3>
  <p>Scrollytelling as the main storytelling technique</p>

  <p>Data sources: Statistics Canada, CMHC, National Bank, Ratehub</p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>The final scrollytelling format allowed me to build a visually compelling and structured narrative. 
    It highlighted how design, storytelling, 
    and data visualization can work together to reveal a complex social issue in a format that’s easy for audiences to understand and emotionally connect with. 
    The biggest learning was understanding how iteration improves clarity—each version clarified the message until the final narrative felt intuitive and complete.</p>
